git status  /*  the command 'git status' tells which files are not added or committed from Working to Staging to Repository */

git commit -m "" /*  Commits and changes to all files that are in Staging into Repo  */

git diff /*  show changes between Working and Local Repo, no file supplied shows all files  */

git diff --staged /*  shows changes between Staged and Local Repo  */--try this out

git rm file.txt /*  will remove file from working then git commit -m "" to also remove from Repo */

git rm --cached file.txt /* leaves copy of file in Working but removes from Staging and Repo */

git mv /*  rename or move files - then git commit -m "" to move to Repo */

git commit -am "text goes here" /* adds all files straight to Repo from Staging if they have changes - meaning they skip git add */ --test this usefull when debugging

git checkout -- file.txt /*  restore Repo file to Working Directory using current branch  */

git reset --soft sha /* changes Repo but not Staging or Working */

/* Diff in Branches */

git branch --merged /*  shows any merged branches */

/* Rename Branch */

git branch -m oldname newname

/* Merge Branch  */

git merge branchname /* be on the receiver branch to merge the other branch */

/* Merge Conflicts between the same file on 2 branches are marked in HEAD and other branch */

/* Manually Fix Files and commit

The Stash */

git stash save "text message here"

/* Remotes
You can push and fetch to the remote server, merge any differences - then push any new to the remote - 3 branches work remote server branch, local origin master and local master

Create a repo in GitHub, then add that remote to your local repo */

git remote add origin https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild.git /*  origin can be named whatever followed by the remote */

git remote /* to show all remotes */ - test this

git remote show origin /*to see remote URL*/ --test this

git remote remove origin /* to remove remote */

git remote rm origin /* to remove remote */

/* Push to Remote from Local */

git push -u origin master /* push to remote(origin) and branch(master)--whats u?

/* Cloning a GitHub Repo - create and get the URL of a new repository from GitHub, then clone that to your local repo, example below uses local repo named 'nameoffolder' */

git clone https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild.git nameoffolder

/* Push to Remote from Local - more - since when we pushed the local to remote we used -u parameter then the remote branch is tracked to the local branch and we just need to use... */

git push

/* Fetch changes from a cloned Repo */

git fetch origin /*  Pulls down latest committs from remote origin/master not origin, also pull down any branches pushed to Repo

Fetch before you work
Fetch before you pull
Fetch often */

/* Merge with origin/master */

git merge origin/master

git pull /* you can also do git pull which is = git fetch + git merge

Checkout/Copy a remote branch to local */

git branch branchname origin/branchname /*  this will bring the remote branch to local and track with the remote */

/* Delete branch */

git branch -d branchname

/* Checkout and switch branch and track to remote */

git checkout -b nontracking origin/nontracking

/* Remove remote branch */

git push origin --delete branch
